A set of Matlab codes for reading Raman spectra, fitting them to Lorentzian peaks,
and plotting maps of peak parameters (height, width, intensity).

The inputs are txt files containing Raman wavelength and intensity in two columns.
The file names contain the coordinates at which the spectra are taken.

"main.m" is the main program.


"Read_Raman_Files.m" reads the txt files and saves the data in 'data.mat'.

"Fit_Raman_Peak.m" is a function that fits the Raman spectra to Lorentzian peaks.
The peak parameters are saved in separate files: '2D.mat', 'G.mat', and 'D.mat'

"Plot_Raman_Maps.m" creates several maps of Raman peak parameters in a single figure.
The function takes optional arguments specifying the criteria for including/excluding 
data points in the maps.
